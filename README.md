# Mingo AR Classroom

Mingo AR Classroom is an AR educational app inspired by Kahoot, designed to gamify the learning experience for students and teachers. It combines the power of AR with engaging gameplay to create an immersive and interactive learning environment.

## Features

- Teachers can create quizzes with various question types (quiz or true/false)
- Unique codes generated for each quiz, ensuring only intended students can join
- Lobby system where students enter the unique code and wait for the teacher to start the game
- Scoring system based on speed and accuracy, with a leaderboard displayed after each question

## To Do

- Customizable avatars: Allow users to personalize their in-app characters or icons, making the experience more engaging and enjoyable.
- Power-ups or rewards: Introduce power-ups or rewards for students who perform well or achieve specific goals. These could be used to boost their scores or provide additional benefits during the game.
- Multiplayer mode: Allow students to collaborate or compete with their classmates in real-time, fostering a sense of community and healthy competition.
- In-app messaging: Enable teachers and students to communicate within the app during the game, allowing for instant feedback, guidance, or clarification.
- Customizable content: Allow teachers to create their quizzes or use pre-built quizzes based on specific subjects or topics. This could save time and make it easier to align the content with their curriculum.
- Integration with other educational platforms: If possible, integrate Mingo AR Classroom with popular learning management systems (LMS) or other educational platforms to streamline the learning experience and make it more accessible to educators and students.
- 3D Avatars: Allow users to create and customize their own 3D avatars that represent them in the app. These avatars can participate in the quizzes, and users can see them in their real environment through AR.
- Immersive questions: Design the quizzes to present questions and answers using AR elements. For instance, if the quiz is about geography, you can project a 3D map in the user's environment and ask them to pinpoint the correct location.
- Interactive answer selection: Enable users to select their answers by interacting with the AR elements directly. For example, they can tap, swipe, or use gestures to choose the correct option.
- Collaborative learning: Allow users to invite friends or other users to join their quiz session, creating a multiplayer experience. Users can see other participants' avatars in their environment and work together to solve the questions.
- AR leaderboards: Display leaderboards in the user's environment, showing the top performers in different categories or quizzes. This can motivate users to improve their performance and compete with others.
- Themed quizzes: Create quizzes with different themes and use AR to enhance the experience. For example, for a history quiz, you can project historical images, artifacts, or scenes in the user's environment.
- Educational rewards: Offer users virtual rewards, such as badges or trophies, that they can collect and display in their AR environment. These rewards can serve as incentives for users to keep participating in quizzes and improving their knowledge.
- Dynamic content: Use AR to keep the quizzes fresh and engaging by updating the questions and answers regularly. This can be achieved by adding new topics, themes, and interactive elements.
- Accessibility: Ensure the app is accessible to users with different abilities by incorporating features like voice recognition, text-to-speech, and customizable font sizes.
- Analytics and insights: Provide users with insights into their performance, strengths, and weaknesses. Use AR to display graphs and charts that help users visualize their progress over time.
